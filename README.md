# Comic Reader

This is an Electron-based program to read comic books from http://readcomiconline.to. Keep in mind they are no way affiliated with this, but I don't feel bad about scraping data from a pirating web site. 

**NOTE: I spend a LOT of money on comics (I bought over 700 last year). I then read them through the website. Also, if I bought all the comics I read on this site, I would be poor, and I have a family to provide for**

That being said, I've actually picked up books that I normally never would have bought, simply because I read them for free and decided to add them to my collection.

List of things to complete (in no particular order):
1) ~~Rewrite the index.html to have all the sections in it, and build a new "page" for the comic itself. The way it's currently building the Reader div is just awful and prone to errors.~~
2) ~~Change the way the Home button works, especially considering the above rewrite~~
3) ~~Add "&readType=1" to all comic book reading links to ensure it displays all images on the page~~
4) Reading List
5) Error handling for things like no internet or for the preloads not returning anything in a timely fashion
6) ~~Build tiles as messages come in instead of building an object and iterating over it~~
7) Fix the Description / Issues. It's hacky, and I don't like it
8) ~~Add loading screen~~
