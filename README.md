# Comic Reader

This is an Electron-based program to read comic books from http://readcomiconline.to. Keep in mind they are no way affiliated with this, but I don't feel bad about scraping data from a pirating web site. 

**NOTE: I spend a LOT of money on comics. I then read them through the website. Also, if I bought all the comics I read on this site, I would be poor, and I have a family to provide for**

That being said, I've actually picked up books that I normally never would have bought, simply because I read them for free and decided to add them to my collection.
